# Hosty
This is a simple menu bar app that provides a gui for searching / editing your hosts file. 

## Why
When working on infra I find myself adding host file entries often to test something before switching the DNS record. This coincided with me wanting to learn more about SwiftUI so I figured why not. Managed to learn how to use traditional AppKit controls in SwiftUI. That combined with with learning about some of the new(ish) Swift features like property wrappers really helped take a lot of the "magic" out of how SwiftUI works
